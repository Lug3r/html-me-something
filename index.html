<h1>Road Warrior</h1>
<p>I played fighting games competitively when Street Fighter 4 released in 2009.  
    I've always played fighting games during my childhood, and 
    one of my favorite characters of the Streetfighter series was Vega.  
    A masked ninja who was one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Shadoloo.  
    So I decided to play him in Street Fighter 4.  I practiced at local hook-ups and local 
    tournaments to prepare for tournaments that were out of state.

<p>My first tournament out of state was at Mid-West Champions 10 in Chicago, IL.  I was a little nervous because
    the tournament had more than 100 entrants.  I knew that playing other players from out of town would be
    a challenge considering I didn't know about their style of play.  One of my first matches was on stream against an old school 
    Street Fighter player from Minnesota by the name of Wes Truelson.
    I was sent to losers side after this match, but I felt like I learned a lot from the match.
    I played a few more matches on losers side and placed 25th.

<p>Iv'e played a lot of good and bad matches but the one match that gave me the confidence 
    to continue competing was my match against Daigo Umehara.  This was in 2010, at a tournament called Season's Beating
    in Columbus, Ohio.  He was considered to be the best Street Fighter player in the world.  He is even in the Guinness
    Book of World Records and on Wikepedia.  When it was time for me to play him, I was thinking to myslef that I'm
    just going to play my play style.  That match was on stream and a lot of people gathered behind us to watch 
    the match that gave me the reputation as one of the strongest Vega players in the country.  I would like to
    note that I had big ego after that match for a while.

<p>I continued to go to many tournaments in the country from San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Orlando, 
    Irvine, Las Vegas, and Seattle.  It was a hobby that I loved and enoyed doing, but I wanted to push myself 
    to see if i could win an annual tournament.  Frosty Faustings VI was the tournament I won in Chicago.  I didn't get
    sent to losers until I went to grand finals and fought Scrimps, who was a player from Indiana.  
    It was a very good match, and I thought I was going to lose.  I kept my composure and claimed victory.
